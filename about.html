            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">Welcome to Vega’s World! Vega is a miniature pinscher, and is
            currently 5 years old. Her favorite activities to pass the time are
            taking a walk, chewing her bones, and sleeping in on the weekends.
            Her favorite food is beef, but she will probably eat anything if she
            is hungry enough. Don’t ever let her know when you are going out
            without taking her -- she will throw a fit when you come back. Most
            important of all, make sure you give her lots of attention (or,
            “Vega lovin”). She loves to be petted on her stomach and behind the ears. <p>
